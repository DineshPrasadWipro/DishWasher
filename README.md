# DishWasher

## Key points
Used MVVM clean architecture and jet pack libraries to develop the application
Koin is used for dependency injection
Wrote unit test cases to ensure code is bug free
## Challenges faced
Fetching price details and setting in main product list
## Suggestion
If price details can add in grid api then no need to call product details api for every product inorder to get
price details
